# Tai

Tai is a Deno badging engine written for Maintained, based on the Maintained badge spec.

It is currently functional, but still WIP as optimizations occur and other Maintained 1.x services reach completion. See [maintainedcc](https://github.com/maintainedcc) for more.

## Features

- Unlimited number of badge fields per badge
- Support for third-party icon sets
- Square icon blocks for enumerated badges
- Extensible StyleDefinitions for adjusting core badge properties
- And therefore, out-of-box advanced customizability for badge styles
